# xrandr_wrapper

This is a wrapper script to manage the location and resolutions of displays connected to a computer running Linux in graphical mode. It is most useful for laptops that often connect to various projectors. It works well for creating resolutions on older VGA projectors that don't return all of the supported resolutions. It requires xrandr and cvt.
